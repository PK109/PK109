- 👋 Hi, I’m @PK109. I am an ambitious person that want to continously develop myself in working with Python.
      I have experience in working with industrial robotics, but it appears that is not enough for my needs. I want more. I want to create automation on higher level.
- 👀 I’m interested in working with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the world of Big Data technologies.
- 💞️ Feel free to share your thoughts in ML and AI field. Do you have an interesting project, where I can help you? Contact me.
